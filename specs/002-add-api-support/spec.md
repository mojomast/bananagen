# Feature Specification: Add API Support for OpenRouter and Requesty Gemini 2.5 Flash

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-api-support`  
**Created**: September 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add api support for openrouter and requesty gemini 2.5 flash"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of Bananagen, I want to be able to generate images using alternative AI APIs like OpenRouter and Requesty, so that I can choose the best provider for my needs or have fallback options.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has API keys configured for OpenRouter, **When** they run `bananagen generate --provider openrouter --prompt "A banana"`, **Then** the system generates an image using OpenRouter's API.
2. **Given** the user has API keys configured for Requesty, **When** they run `bananagen generate --provider requesty --prompt "A banana"`, **Then** the system generates an image using Requesty's API.
3. **Given** the user specifies an unsupported provider, **When** they run the generate command, **Then** the system displays an error message listing supported providers.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the API key for the selected provider is invalid or missing?
- How does the system handle rate limits or temporary unavailability of the provider?
- What if the provider returns an error or malformed response?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support image generation using OpenRouter API.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support image generation using Requesty API.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to specify the API provider via CLI option (e.g., --provider).
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate API keys for the selected provider before attempting generation.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages when provider is unsupported or API key is invalid.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle provider-specific response formats and errors gracefully.
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing Gemini-based workflows.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **API Provider**: Represents a supported AI API service, with attributes like name, endpoint, authentication method.
- **API Key**: Represents user credentials for a provider, linked to the provider.
