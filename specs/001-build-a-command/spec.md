# Feature Specification: Build a command-line tool called bananagen

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-command`  
**Created**: September 10, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a command-line tool called **bananagen**.

What it is & why:
- A CLI tool that produces ready-to-use image assets by driving the Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash image generation) model from a developer-friendly interface.
- Primary use: generate placeholder/template images of an exact size, pass those templates to Gemini alongside a prompt so generated images match expected dimensions, and save the resulting image(s) plus metadata for use in projects.
- Secondary value: speed up asset creation in projects (web, games, UI), support batch workflows, and allow coding agents (roo code, Claude Code, etc.) to call bananagen programmatically as a tool.

Core features (what, not how):
1. **Placeholder generator** ‚Äî create blank template images (width, height, optional transparent background, color, padding, filename pattern).
2. **Gemini generation adapter** ‚Äî takes a placeholder + prompt, calls Gemini (nano banana 2.5 flash) to create the final image, stores image and response metadata.
3. **Batch mode** ‚Äî accept a list (JSON/CSV/YAML) or directory of jobs and process sequentially or concurrently with safe rate-limiting and retries.
4. **Scan-and-replace mode** ‚Äî scan a repo or asset directory for placeholder images (by filename pattern or embedded metadata) and replace them with generated images using context extracted from surrounding files (alt text, filenames, JSON front-matter, README, manifest).
5. **Agent-friendly interface** ‚Äî provide programmatic entry points (machine-readable CLI flags and JSON output; optional local HTTP JSON API) so coding agents can call bananagen as a tool.
6. **Metadata & provenance** ‚Äî store each generation‚Äôs metadata (prompt, model, seed, params, timestamp, source placeholder, gemini response id, sha256) to allow reproducibility and audits.
7. **Developer ergonomics** ‚Äî dry-run, --json output, logging, configurable concurrency, retry/backoff policies, ability to preview prompts before committing replacements.

Non-functional goals:
- Deterministic and idempotent where possible (record seeds / params).
- Clear machine-readable responses for agents (JSON outputs, stable exit codes).
- Small dependency surface and easy to install.
- Safe defaults (dry-run for replacing files, confirmations optional)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to use bananagen to generate image assets for my projects, so that I can quickly create placeholders and final images matching specific dimensions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a specified width and height, **When** the user runs bananagen placeholder command, **Then** a blank placeholder image is generated and saved.
2. **Given** a placeholder image and a text prompt, **When** the user runs bananagen generate command, **Then** the Gemini model generates a final image matching the placeholder dimensions and saves it with metadata.
3. **Given** a batch file with multiple jobs, **When** the user runs bananagen batch command, **Then** all jobs are processed with rate-limiting and retries.
4. **Given** a directory with placeholder images, **When** the user runs bananagen scan command, **Then** placeholders are replaced with generated images using context from surrounding files.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Gemini API rate limit is exceeded?
- How does the system handle invalid image formats or corrupted placeholders?
- What if the prompt is empty or contains inappropriate content?
- How does the system behave when network connectivity is lost during generation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate placeholder images of specified width, height, with optional transparent background, color, padding, and filename pattern.
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept a placeholder image and prompt, call Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate the final image, and save it along with metadata.
- **FR-003**: System MUST support batch processing from JSON, CSV, or YAML files, or directories, with sequential or concurrent execution, rate-limiting, and retries.
- **FR-004**: System MUST scan repositories or asset directories for placeholder images and replace them with generated images using context from filenames, alt text, JSON front-matter, README, or manifest files.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide machine-readable CLI flags, JSON output, and optional local HTTP JSON API for programmatic use by coding agents.
- **FR-006**: System MUST store metadata for each generation including prompt, model, seed, parameters, timestamp, source placeholder, Gemini response ID, and SHA256 hash for reproducibility and audits.
- **FR-007**: System MUST support dry-run mode, JSON output, logging, configurable concurrency, retry/backoff policies, and prompt preview before committing replacements.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Image Asset**: Represents a generated or placeholder image, with attributes like file path, dimensions, format, and associated metadata.
- **Generation Job**: Represents a task to generate an image, with attributes like prompt, source placeholder, output path, and parameters.
- **Metadata Record**: Represents provenance data for a generation, with attributes like prompt, model, seed, timestamp, response ID, and hash.
